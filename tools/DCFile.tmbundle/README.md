# TextMate Bundle for DC files (*.dc)

A TextMate bundle for the DistributedClass language. This bundle provides a
very basic form of syntax highlighting to DC files!

## Installation

If you are using a JetBrains' IntelliJ IDE, simply go to File > Settings >
Editor > TextMate Bundles, and press the '+' icon to add a TM bundle. All
you need to do is point it to the path of this folder, `DCFile.tmbundle`.

If you are using TextMate, you can install this bundle in TextMate by opening
the preferences and going to the bundles tab. After installation it will be
automatically updated for you.
