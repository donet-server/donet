Donet is a free and open source network engine designed after the Distributed
Networking protocol,  as defined in the high-level networking API of the
[Panda3D](https://panda3d.org) game engine, which was originally developed by
Disney Interactive (*formerly known as Disney VR Studios*) to connect with
their in-house server technology, the OTP (*Online Theme Park*) server, which
was used to power their massive multiplayer online games, such as Toontown
Online and Pirates of the Caribbean Online, from 2001 to 2013.

## Getting Started

The Donet repository is a monorepo that houses two main Rust projects:
- **donet** - The Donet daemon source, which includes all the Donet services.
See [donet-server.org](https://www.donet-server.org).
- **donet-core** - The core utilities for Donet services, including datagram
utilities and the DC language parser. See
[docs.donet-server.org](https://docs.donet-server.org/master/library).

Please read the
[introduction to Donet](https://docs.donet-server.org/master/introduction)
for an overview of the project and how the engine works.
